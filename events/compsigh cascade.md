## Riddle one

You are an old, senile CS professor walking around the twisting halls of Kalmanovitz.

You're given a 2D character array containing the letters R and L, starting from the top left corner going down, validate whether or not the agent will reach the bottom right corner.

output: array of tuples representing x,y coords
