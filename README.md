## Riddle one

You are an old, senile CS professor walking around the twisting halls of Kalmanovitz.

You're given a *2D* character array containing the letters `R`, `L`, and `#`. Starting from the top left corner going down, validate whether or not the agent will reach the bottom right corner.

output: array of tuples representing x,y coords of every position you turn at followed by whether you made it to the bottom right corner. coords are starting at 1, 1 from the top left and increasing going down and right

### Example

**Input:**
```
# R R #
L L R #
R # # #
# L # #
```

**Output:**
```
#LLRRRL#L##
```
