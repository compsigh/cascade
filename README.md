## Riddle one

You are an old, senile CS professor walking around the twisting halls of Kalmanovitz.

**Input:** You're given a *2D* character array with `R`, `L`, and `#`. Starting from the top left, navigate using the current tile: `R` means right, `L` means left, and `#` means straight. Each turn is relative to your current direction.

**Output:** List every tile you visit from start to finish. You start and end on `#`.

### Example

**Input:**
```
# R R #
L L R #
R # # #
# L # #
```

**Output:**
```
#LLRRRL#L##
```
