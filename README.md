[compsigh](https://compsigh.club/)'s one-night coding riddle competition web framework

# How it Works

Currently build in Next.js and deployed to Vercel.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Whole-night event, till midnight rather than 90 mins
- [ ] Ladder, similar to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), rather than just three
- [ ] Solution is all one related riddle (find a way to make refactoring not a pain in the ass) and should work on previous inputs
- [ ] Private riddle repo just to store the riddles and a protected API server that returns a Markdown string; open-source platform
- [ ] One minute cooldown for submitting answers
- [ ] Secure Server Actions

### Areas of confusion & improvement

- Some people tried to check their emails for a notification
- Some people weren't sure why you had to reload the page to see an invite
